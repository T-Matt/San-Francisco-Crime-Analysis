# San-Francisco-Crime-Analysis

Growing up in San Francisco, California, I often heard about fluctuations in crime. Particularly in recent years as car break-ins, assaults, robberies, and shoplifting have become increasingly prevalent. This project aims to leverage real crime databases to visualize and analyze the prevalence of crimes over time. By identifying patterns and trends, this analysis provides valuable insights into how crime evolves across different periods. The ultimate goal is to empower local policymakers with data-driven insights, enabling them to craft more effective policies that address the root causes of these issues and promote safer communities.
